Secure Cloud-Based Personal Health Record (PHR) System
Overview:
This project aims to develop a secure, cloud-based Personal Health Record (PHR) system using Python. The system allows users to manage their health information, including adding, viewing, and sharing data securely with healthcare providers. The project utilizes agile methodologies, focuses on user needs through personas and user stories, employs a microservices architecture for scalability and maintenance, and emphasizes security and privacy in all aspects of the application.

Features:
Login Interface: Implemented a simple login interface for users to authenticate.
Authentication: Implemented user authentication using username and password stored in a MySQL database.
Token-based Authentication: Used JWT tokens for secure communication between the client and server.
Health Data Management: Enables users to add, view, and update their health information, including medical history, medications, allergies, and lab results.
Secure Sharing: Implemented secure sharing of health records with healthcare providers through token-based authentication.
Access Control: Implemented role-based access control to ensure only authorized users can access and modify health records.
Data Encryption: Implemented encryption of health records to ensure data privacy and confidentiality.
Audit Trail: Tracks access and modifications to health records for accountability and compliance.
Usage:
Installation:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies: RUN pip install --no-cache-dir PyJWT cryptography  mysql-connector-python
Set up MySQL database with the required schema.
Running the Server:

Run the server: python Server.py
Access the application at http://localhost:8000
Login:

Visit /login to access the login page.
Enter valid username and password to log in. (Example: username: user1, password: password1)
Health Data Management:

After logging in, users can add, view, and update their health information.
Secure Sharing:

Share health records with healthcare providers securely through token-based authentication.
Access Control:

Role-based access control ensures only authorized users can access and modify health records.
Data Encryption:

Health records are encrypted to ensure data privacy and confidentiality.
Audit Trail:

Tracks access and modifications to health records for accountability and compliance.
Example Code:
python
Copy code
import requests

# Send login request
login_url = 'http://localhost:8000/login'
login_data = {'username': 'user1', 'password': 'password1'}
login_response = requests.post(login_url, data=login_data)

# Extract token from response
if login_response.status_code == 200:
    token = login_response.json().get('token')
    if token:
        # Include token in request to protected endpoint
        protected_url = 'http://localhost:8000/protected'
        headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
        protected_response = requests.get(protected_url, headers=headers)
        print(protected_response.json())
    else:
        print('Token not found in login response')
else:
    print('Login failed:', login_response.json())

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic version of a secure, cloud-based Personal Health Record (PHR) system. With additional refinement and testing, the system can be deployed for real-world use, providing users with a reliable and secure platform for managing their health information.
